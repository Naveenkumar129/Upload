ChatGPT said:
The command you provided:

tar zcvf abc.tar abc33
Here's what each part does:

tar: The command used to create or manipulate tar archives.

z: Compress the archive using gzip.

c: Create a new archive.

v: Verbosely list files processed (shows progress).

f abc.tar: Specifies the filename of the archive to be created (abc.tar).

abc33: The file or directory to include in the archive.

So, this command creates a gzip-compressed tar archive named abc.tar that contains the abc33 file or directory.

If you want the archive to have a .tar.gz extension (which is more conventional for gzip-compressed tarballs), you can use:

tar zcvf abc.tar.gz abc33

Subject: Farewell and Thank You

Dear Colleagues,

With mixed emotions and a heavy heart, I write to share that today marks my last day at SAB.

It's hard to put into words what this incredible journey has meant to me. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside some of the most talented, passionate, and compassionate individuals I could ever ask for. Together, we’ve faced challenges, celebrated wins, and grown both professionally and personally.

I am deeply grateful for the experiences, the lessons learned, and the many friendships formed along the way. Each step of this journey has shaped the person I am today. I leave with immense appreciation and admiration for all of you and for the vision of this amazing organization.

A special thank you to for your support and collaboration across various assignments and projects. It has been an honor to work with you.

As I look ahead to new opportunities, I carry with me the relationships, memories, and values that made my time here so meaningful. I hope we will stay in touch, and I will always remain loyal to SAB and wish you continued success in all that you do.

Let’s keep in contact!

Warm regards,

Task
Write a Helm template to:

Generate volumeMounts from a list in values.yaml.
Each mount should include additional metadata using dict.
values.yaml
yaml
Copy code
volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    path: /etc/config
  - name: data-volume
    path: /var/data
template.yaml
yaml
Copy code
volumeMounts:
{{- range .Values.volumes }}
  {{- $mount := dict "name" .name "path" .path }}
  - name: {{ $mount.name }}
    mountPath: {{ $mount.path }}
{{- end }}
Expected Output
yaml
Copy code
volumeMounts:
  - name: config-volume
    mountPath: /etc/config
  - name: data-volume
    mountPath: /var/data
---

env:
{{- range $index, $item := .Values.config }}
  - name: {{ $item.key | upper }}
    value: "{{ $item.value }}"
{{- end }}

Exercise 3: Passing Context to an Included Template
Task
Create an included template that generates an environment variable block for a container. Pass data as context to customize the output.

----

Exercise 2: Nesting Includes
Task
Use a nested include to generate resource names dynamically based on a prefix and suffix.

Steps
Define a helper template in _helpers.tpl for the prefix:

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "mychart.fullResourceName" (dict "name" "deployment" "context" .) }}
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ include "mychart.fullResourceName" (dict "name" "app" "context" .) }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ include "mychart.fullResourceName" (dict "name" "app" "context" .) }}
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: {{ include "mychart.fullResourceName" (dict "name" "container" "context" .) }}
        image: nginx

Look for confirmation messages:
- Kafka: **"Started NetworkTrafficServerConnector"** or **"Kafka server started"**.
- ZooKeeper: **"binding to port 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181"**.

---

### **2. Verify Service Resolution**
Inside the Docker network, check if Kafka and ZooKeeper can resolve each other's names using DNS:
```bash
docker exec kafka ping zookeeper
docker exec zookeeper ping kafka

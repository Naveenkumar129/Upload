What is Kafka?

Every Enterprise is powered by data.
We take information in, analyze it, manipulate it and creates more as output.
Every application creates data, whether it is log messages,metrics,user activity,out going messages, or something else.
Every byte of data has a story to tell, something of imporatance that will inform the next thing to be done.
In order to know what that is, we need to get the data from where it is created to where it can be analyzed.

We see this every day on websites like amazon,youtube,facebook, where our "clicks" on on items of interest to use are turned into recommmendations that are shown to us litte later.

The faster we can do this, the more agile and resonsive our organizations can be.
The less effort we spend on moving data around, the more we can focus on the core business at hand.

      "This is why the pipeline is a critical component in the data driven enterpise"

Publish and Subscribe Messaging (data):
.......................................

Before discussing the Apache Kafka , it is imporant for us to understand the concept of pub/sub messaging and why it is important.

Pub and sub messaging is  a pattern that is characterized by the sender(publisher) of a piece of data (message) not spcificially directing to a reciver, Instead, the publisher classifies the message somewhat, and that receiver(subscriber) subscribes to receive certain of classes of messages.

Pub /Sub systems often have a broker, a central point where messages are published , to facilite this.
.....................................................................................
			  How enterprise systems handles data
			             (Pre Kafka)
....................................................................................

Many use cases for pub/sub starts with same way.

   With a simple message queue or interprocess communication channel

for eg, you create an application that needs to send montioring information somewhere. How do you send?

You write monitoring message in a direct connection from your application to an application that displays your metrics on a dashboard, push metrics over that connection.

let us say, you have systems, that system has two servers - frontend server,
back end server

both server sends metrics data to metrics server

		FrontEnd               BackEnd Server
		  Server
		    |				|
		    |				|
		--------------------------------------
				|
			    Mertics Server


If your server is running in clustered env

		FrontEnd               FrontEnd Server

		 Backend               Backend Server
		  Server
		    |				|
		    |				|
		--------------------------------------
				|
			    Mertics Server


A single , direct metric servers irresptive of how many backend and front end server

This looks a simple soultion to a problem that works when you are going to getting started with monitoring.

Before long,you decide you would like to analyze your metircs over a longer term,
that doesnot work very well in dashboard.

When you introduce new service in your biz and where you have to introduce server,
Now you have three more apps, that generating metrics data ,then metrics server need connect directly , recive,store,anaylze

Every Pub sub system is going to store messages inside "Queue" , the basic data storage model.
In the above system we have only one /Single /Individual Queue System.

Image one of your coworkers has been doing similar work with log messages, another has been working on tracking user behavior on the frontend website and providing that information to developers who are working on machine learning,
As well as creating some reports for management.

Now at last , we have refactored our system, but there is lot of "Duplication"
Your company is maintaining multiple systems for queuing data, all of which have their own individual bugs and limitations.
You will have more systems in future it will come.
            
                 "What if i would like to have single centeralized system

....................................................................................
			Birth of Kafka :Entering into Kafka
....................................................................................	
Apache Kafka is pub/sub messaging system designed to solve the above problem.
Instead of having multiple  Queue System, we can have only one System where we receive message,organize the message,store,process,and produce the report.

Kafka inspired from "Logging System" or Loggers to store messages, instead of storing message in traditional messaging systems.

Traditional Messaging Systems:
..............................

Traditional Messaging systems are built based on the standards like "AMQP" protocal.
Any pub/sub messaging product like rabbit mq is built on the standards only.

According to the AMQP Standards.
 
1.Messages are stored in a queue
2.Queue stores messages which is tranisent by default. if you want you can persit in disk.
3.The messages can be altered(update,delete)
4.The messages are deleted once it is consumed

	    "Kafka was not designed based on Traditional Messaging System"

.....................................................................................
		    "Kafka was designed based on  Loggers"
	
What is Log?
   Tracking activites of an application,store those activites in "memory or in  a disk file" in order to analyze them in furture.

If you are developer, you encounter loggers every day in your development cycle.

Logs gives complete information about the system which is running.

if you are java developer, you might have used various logging implementations.
We call as "Logging Frameworks"

Log gives just information about what just happened or happing in your system for eg
some warings,some info,some bugs, some tracking , some tracing..........

Logs :
2016-06-16 17:02:13 TRACE Trace log message
2016-06-16 17:02:13 DEBUG Debug log message
2016-06-16 17:02:13 INFO  Info log message
2016-06-16 17:02:13 ERROR Error log message
.....................................................................................
			 Log structure and its characteristics
.....................................................................................

Log information is stored in a file called "Log file" - system.log
Log file is used for future analytics such as debugging,finding warnings,errors...

What is difference between "normal files" and log files?

=>Log files are "append only", you cant add any new entry in between, which makes the file "immutable" - cant be edited or read only.
=>Normal files are based on "Edit Mode" or Replace mode
    Files are edited or replaced later.

		  "Kafka is just based on Log System"
		       Kafka is just Logger System

    Since kafka is logger system is it same as "Slf4j,log4j" Kind of loggers.
			
Some what yes, but Kafka is more beyond that....

		Kafka is not based on "traditional log files" 


Kafka is fundmentally based on "Commit Logs"

What is commit log?
    "In data management platforms, a commit is making set of tenative changes permanent".
    "Making the end of a transaction and providing Durablity to ACID transactions"
  The record of commits is called "Commit log"

The record of commits is called "Commit Log"

What Kafka is going to record into commit log?
     Kafka was designed to store informations(data).

What type of information?
  Any type of information we can store into commit log.
.....................................................................................
			  Event
....................................................................................
What is Event?
   An Event is any type of action,incident,or change are happening or just happened
for eg:
  Now i am typing,Now i am teaching - happening
  Just i had coffee,Just i received mail, just i clicked a link, just i search product - happened.
  
   An Event is just remainder or notification of  your happenings or happened.
...................................................................................
		     Event Driven Architecture(Software system)
....................................................................................

The Software system can track what is happening, just happended , stores into a file called commit log, later that commit log can be replayed to process those events to produce various reports

Let us imagine, You have mobile apps, which tracks your locations where ever you move, those locations are recorded into a file by "Event Driven System"(Kafka).
Based on those data , you can get report like that where were you at morning,afternoon,evening...

Eg:
 Today stock price is $40 at 10Am
 I met my friend yesterday at east coast road
 Made payment of $500 to Ramesh

Imgaine i need  somebody or somthing should record every activity of my life from the early moring when i get up and till bed.

	  There is a system to record every events of your life that is called 
			      Kafka

	 Kafka is Event Processing Software , which process events
.....................................................................................
			Event Architecture
.....................................................................................

How kafka has been implemented?

   "Kafka is a software"
   "Kafka is a file(Commit log file) processing software
   "Kafka is written in java and scala" - Kafka is just java application
   "In order to run Kafka we need JVM"

How event is represented into kafka?

	Event is just a message.
        Every message has its own arch.
        In Kafka the Event/Message is called as "Record".

Event Contains Two things:
..........................
1.What happened/Happing - Name of the Event
2.State - Data

State:
......
  The state is nothing but data.


State Representation:

 In General state(data) is stored in relational databases "as table"
 A table represents the state of something like 
    User - id,name,email,password,city

Since User data can be stored and proceed into tables.

Can we store events into table?
   Events also has state like things(user,customer,product) in real time.

We can but not all types of events into table.
.....................................................................................
			    Modern Data Modeling
.....................................................................................
     Generally domains are modeled based on "Things(Customer,Order,Payment) first"
		Now a days People started thinking based on Events first
          Instead of storing things into database , we store events

Events also has some state like "Things"

   "Events has some description of what happened with it", but Primary idea is that          event is indication in time that thing took place".

How to store events?
   Logs - Log is structured and the sequence  of the evnets occured in the method calls.

			Core concepts of Kafka
.....................................................................................

Broker:
.......
   Since Kafka is a java program which is deployed on JVM,Kafka runs on the JVM Which is process.
   The JVM is other wise called as "Kafka Broker or Kafka Server"
.....................................................................................
			 Types of Kafka Broker
.....................................................................................

Kafka has been designed based on "Distributed Architecture" - By Default Kafka is distributed.

General Characteritics of Disbutributed Architecture:
.....................................................

1.Scalablity
    Running more than one process,hosting the same app. Running the same app on    multiple servers.

Cluster:
  When we scale apps into multiple servers, we need to group them under a single unit.
  Group of machines are called as "cluster"

2.High Availablity:
   if any one server fails in the cluster, clients should not be affected, we need to make our app always available.
   How to make highly available?
      Via cluster

Kafka uses distributed features such as cluster

In kafka we can run "Multiple Brokers" as a cluter.

Kafak cluster can be in the same machine or across machines in network.
.....................................................................................
			   Cluster Manager
.....................................................................................

In any distributed arch, if machines are running in a cluster or clusters , the cluster need to mananged.
Who can manage cluster?
   Cluster Manager.

Kafka and cluster Manager:
  Kafka is distributed, runs in a cluster, we need to manage that cluster.
Kafka provides cluster manager
  =>ZooKeeper - It is distributed cluster manager software
  =>KRaft -  it is new cluster manager inside Kafka cluster.

if you run single broker or multiple brokers we need to have cluster manager.

1.Apache Zookeeper:
	ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. 
2.Apache KRaft:
    KRaft is consenus protocal that was introduced to replace ZooKeeper for meta data management

Roles of Cluster Managers:
1.To manage cluster
2.Failures detections and recovery
3.Storing ACL and secrets
.....................................................................................

Lab 1:
 Kafka Cluster setup 
 Single broker, single zookeeper.

configuration files:
 cd config
subugee@LAPTOP-R2TGGFDL:~/kafkatraining/apacheKafka/kafka-3.4.1-src/config$ ls
connect-console-sink.properties    connect-file-source.properties   consumer.properties  server.properties
connect-console-source.properties  connect-log4j.properties         kraft                tools-log4j.properties
connect-distributed.properties     connect-mirror-maker.properties  log4j.properties     trogdor.conf
connect-file-sink.properties       connect-standalone.properties    producer.properties  zookeeper.properties


zookeeper:
 Has a config file called config/zookeeper.properties

dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper
    The directory where the snapshot of cluster information is stored.

clientPort=2181
  The Port at which clients connect , 
  who is client? Kafka Broker is client.

Steps:
 =>Start zooKeeper

./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh  config/zookeeper.properties
Classpath is empty. Please build the project first e.g. by running './gradlew jar -PscalaVersion=2.13.10'

if you see the above error, that means your distribution is source code distribution so you have to build it.

How to build?
./gradlew jar -PscalaVersion=2.13.10

			  Exploring Kafka Logs
.....................................................................................

There two category of logs
1.cluster manager - zookeeper or kRaft 
2.Borker logs

The location of log files are declared in the config files

zookeeper.properties

dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper

server.properties
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
.....................................................................................
			      Topics
.....................................................................................

What is Topic?
  There are lot of events, we need to organize them in the system.
  Apach Kafka's most fundamental unit of organization is the topic.

  Topic is just like tables in the relational database.

  As we discussed already, Kafka just stores in events in the log files.

  We never writes events into log file directly

  As a developer we capture events, write them into "topic",Kafka writes events into   log file from the topic.

  A topic is log of events,logs are easy to understand

  Topic is just simple datastructure with well known semantics, They are append only.

  When ever you write a  message, it always goes on the end

  When you read message from the logs by "Seeking offset in the log"

  Logs are fundamental durable things,Traditional Messaging systems have topics and   queues which store messages temporarily to buffer them between source and   designation.

  Since topics are logs , which always permenant.
  
  You can delete log files not log messages.

  You can store logs as short as to as long as years or even retain message     indefinitely.
.....................................................................................
			How to create topics
.....................................................................................

In order to create topic, we need somebody to create topic.

Actors In kafka Systems:
........................

1.Producer
   The Producer is a program whose responsability to capture events,and send events to Kafka broker.
   Producer will publish events into topic.
2.Consumer
 The Consumer is a program whose responsability to read events from the topic

Producer and consumers can be written any programming language which supports kafka integration.

Producers can be java program or node.js program or python or c#
Consumer can be java program or node.js program or python or c#

Other than programming languages , Kafka supports cli tools.
.....................................................................................
			 kafka-topics.sh
....................................................................................

This is a cli tool used to create,delete,describe, or update the topic.

--delete --topic todos-topic

./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete --topic todos-topic

once the delete command is executed, the topic is renamed rather it wont delete from the disk permanently.

Its simply rename the folder's name.

                                           is the option to control `linger.ms`
                                           in producer configs. (default: 1000)
--topic <String: topic>                  REQUIRED: The topic id to produce

			Log Retention
.....................................................................................

By default , events(messages) are stored into topic, topic finally persits into log file.

Can i delete events from the log file?
 No, Kafka log messages/events are immutable - readonly.

can i delete log files?
  Yes you can delete log files.

if you delete log files , you configure policies which is called as "Log Rentention Policy"

Log Retension policy can be set "Broker Level" or "Topic Level"

If you set policy at broker level, which is applied to all topics which are created insid broker.

you can set policy at topic level, which is applied to only that topic only.

Broker Level Configuration:
...........................
The policy can  be set to delete log file after "a period of time", or after "a given size has accumulated".

Period of time :
  I want to delete log files after 7 days, 7 months, 7 weeks, 7 years,7 mins,7 sec,7 ms
A Given size accumulated:
   i want to delete log files once the file size reaches 1gb
   You have to set value in bytes
   The value must be postive integer
   if you set -1, meaning that no limit on size 


Time based configuration:

log.retention.hours=168 
   By default 7 days, one week
log.retention.minutes=10
   mins based config
log.rentiontion.ms=100
    milli secs based configuration

Size based configuraton
log.retention.bytes=1073741824
  To delete logs based on the total number of bytes it retained 
 by default 1 gb.

Topic level configuration:

When we create topic or when alter topic 

--config <String: name=value>            A topic configuration override for the
                                           topic being created or altered. The
                                           following is a list of valid
                                           configurations:
                                                cleanup.policy
                                                compression.type
                                                delete.retention.ms
                                                file.delete.delay.ms
                                                flush.messages
                                                flush.ms
                                                follower.replication.throttled.

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
# log.retention.hours=168
log.retention.minutes=1
# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
#log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
# log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000
 log.retention.check.interval.ms=3000
.....................................................................................

Lab :
Create topic with rentension policy

$./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic hello-topic --config retention.ms=20000

Produce some events
 ./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-topic

consume events
 ./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-topic --from-beginning --property print.timestamp=true

Wait for 2 mins and check the messages again. you can notice , messages have been log files been deleted
....................................................................................
			      Dynamic Configuration
....................................................................................

Broker is running in production, broker has many topics already created , having some logs also.

By default Brokers and topics configurations are dervied from global "server.properties" file and default configurations supplied by kafka

What if i want to override like broker configuration or topic configuration during runtime : dynamic configurations

Overriding Topic Configuration Defaults

Dynamic Kafka Broker configuration change using the kafka-configs CLI

Broker level configurations:
.............................
//Adding or editing existing broker level settings

$ ./bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --entity-type brokers --entity-default --add-config min.insync.replicas=2 


//We can delete the dynamic configuration as well:

./bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --entity-type brokers --entity-default  --delete-config min.insync.replicas


Topics:
egs:
./bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
                --alter --entity-type topics \
                --entity-name configured-topic \
                --add-config max.message.bytes=10485880


Alter topic with rention policy:

Lab:
Steps:
1.create a new topic with default settings
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic payment-topic
2.Alter topic configuration like log retention policy
 ./bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --entity-type topics --entity-name payment-topic --add-config retention.ms=20000

After alertering , check the same process like above

3.produce message 
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic payment-topic
4.consume message
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic payment-topic --from-beginning
.....................................................................................
		How to see the configurations applied?

 ./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic payment-topic

Topic: payment-topic    TopicId: krK_YW-aQiOm0tG2DEOxQg PartitionCount: 1       ReplicationFactor: 1    Configs: retention.ms=20000

				Partition
.....................................................................................

What is partition?
    In order to distributethe "Storage and Processing of Events" in a topic, Kafka uses the concept called "Partition"
	
    The topic is made of  one or More partitions.
The topic is broken into multiple partitions
  
  Every partion is is just folder only.

  Each partition will have its own log files

			   payment-topic
				|
		-------------------------------------------------
		|               |              |
	   payment-topic-0  payment-topic-1  payment-topic-2
                |                |               |
            log files       log files         log files


By default every topic has only one partition.

Lab:
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic sales-topic --paritions 2

This command will create two partitions
 
After supplying partition option you can see inside kafka-logs folder

/tmp/kafka-logs
       |
       sales-topic-0
       sales-topic-1

How to know many partitions are there in the topic

./bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic sales-topic

Topic: sales-topic   TopicId: Qld8IMqPSDqV7YMHB-dT4Q PartitionCount: 2       ReplicationFactor: 1   Configs:
      Topic: sales-topic      Partition: 0    Leader: 0       Replicas: 0     Isr: 0
      Topic: sales-topic      Partition: 1    Leader: 0       Replicas: 0     Isr: 0


Why Partitions?

=>Partitions helps to distribute messages into multiple log files so that we dont need to dump into one single file, we scale the message across multiple files
=>This partition is also unit of parallelism.
.....................................................................................
				Segements
....................................................................................
What is segment?
  Segement is just actual log files contains "Records"

Topics are broken into partions , and Partitions are broken into segements

How to list segements(Log file)

Here segement is group files
.log
.index
.timeindex

Segement is just log file where actual records is stored.
Records are stored as "Byte Array"

.log file stores actaual Records.
.....................................................................................
			 Segment File or Log File Architecture
.....................................................................................

How events or data or message is stored into segement?

 The log file is structured with two parts

 1.Actual data- event
 2.Offset

Actual data is  published into segement as "record" which is simple byte array.

Offset:
  An Offset into a file is simply the charactor location within that file,usually starting with 0; thus offset 240" is actually the 241st byte in the file.


 a   b  c   d  e  f  g                   =>actual record
-------------------------------------------------------
 0   1  2   3  4  5  6                    =>Offset 
--------------------------------------------------

A Partition can have multiple segement meaning that i can have multile log files

How to represent multiple segements?

Segement-0        Segment-1                Segement-2 
Offset 0-957 =>   Offset 958 to 1675  ==>  offset 1676 --?   <==Writes

Only one Segement can be active at any point in time

The segement size is determined by the property

log.segment.bytes
  The maximum size of a single log file.
  When it reaches , kafka will create new one.

log.segement.ms
  The kafka will wait before commiting(Writing data) the segement
 default 1 week.

Note:
   A kafka broker keeps an open file handler to every active segement in every partion, even for inactive segements. This leads to a usually high number of open file handles, and the OS must be tuned accordingly.
.....................................................................................

Lab:
 in order to create new log files
config/server.properties
log.segment.bytes=1000
1.start zookeeper and kafka broker
2.create topic with single partition
3.Keep on publishing  messages  until it reaches 1000 bytes
4.see the log locations /tmp/kafka-logs

Sometimes when you’re working with Kafka, you may find yourself needing to manually inspect the underlying logs of a topic.

Whether you’re just curious about Kafka internals or you need to debug an issue and verify the content, the kafka-dump-log command is your friend

			 Events/Message Distributions and Partitions
.....................................................................................

Topics are broken into partions, partions are broken into segements

As Producer we send data to the Topic only, Topic distributes message among partitions

Partitioner:
   Partitioner is  a process that will determine to which partition a specific message/event will be assigned.

 In Nutshell Partitioner is simple "Java Class/Program" having routing algorithim.
 This algorthim decides where to go.

For eg i have topic with 3 partition

 Record===>Publish==>Partitioner===>where to to =>P1 Or P2 Or P3

How  partitions are selected by Partitioner?
 =>Based on Record only.

Record contains information for how to select Partition

Partitioner Algorthims:
.......................
1.Round Robin Alogorthim
2.Sticky Partitioner Alogorthim
3.Key Based Alogorthim

Round Robin Algorthim:
  It is default algorthim used in kafka old versions less than 2.3
Lets i assum i have two partitions

 M1 ------->P1
 M2 ------->P2
 M3-------->P1
 M4-------->P2
In round robin messages are distributed equally to all paritions

Drawback of Round Robin Algorthim:
...................................
 if more messages and more partitions, there is possiblity of higher latency and low performance...

Sticky Partitioner:
...................
  It is built on the top of Round robin only.
  Stick Partitioner wont send indidual message/record rather it sends as batch.
  It improves the peformance, reduces network latency.
  This is default Partitioner in the lastest kafka 

Message/Record Structure:

 In kafka messages are organized based on "Key-Value" Pair.
 By default every message has key "null" key

Lab: 
 To Test whether a message has key or not

./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic todos-topic --from-beginning --property print.key=true

null    Learn Kafka
null    Learn Event Driven Architecture
null    Learn What is Event
null    Learn java

Here "null" is key "Learn kafka" is value

You can notice there is another partitioner alogthrim called "Key" based 

        "If you produce message/record/event without key means with null key"
			  Partitioner
		 Selects "Sticky Partitioner" 
			  By Default

Sticky Partition  = "RoundRobin + Batching"

  	How key-value pair messages are distributed to partitions
...................................................................................
In the old, kafka they used "round robind".
There is problem when i send the event with same, it is distributed in different partitions which is not that much efficient.

Kafka introduced an alorithim called "Key Hashing Algorithm"

Key hahing is the process of determining the mapping of a key to a partition in the default partitioner.
The keys are hashed based on an algorthim called "murmur2 "

  Targetpartition = Math.abs(Util.murmur2(KeyInBytes) % (numPartiontions-1) 
   
Note;
  if you have same key ,but different values, the same partition will be used

			 Kafka Internal Architecture
....................................................................................

Kafka broker and cluster contains two major components.

1.Control Plane
2.Data Plane

Kafaka cluster is broken into two segement

1.Meta data management
   It is nothing but to take care of Managing the entire cluster   
2.Actual data storage
   Where actual data is stored.

.................................................................................
				Kafka Request

Client requests in kafka fall into two category

=>Produce Request and fetch requests.

Produce Request:

    A produce requestis requesting that a batch of data to be written into  a specified topic (producers)

Consumer Request

=>Fetch Request:
   A request is requesting data from kafa topics(consumers)


Internal work flow for both producer request (produce request) and consumer (consume request) remanins same.

....................................................................................
				Produce Request
...................................................................................

When a producer is ready to send an event record.

What is event Record?
  Event Record is nothing the message what we sent from the producer, the message structure /event structure is called "Record".

Record consits of the following properties:

1.timestamp
2.key
3.value
4.Headers


When a producer is ready to send an event record,it will use a configurable partitioner to determine the topic partition to assign to the record.

if record has key, then the default partitioner will use a hash of the key to determine the correct partition.
if any records with same key will always be assigned to the same partition.
if the record has no key then a partitioner startegy is used to balance the data in the partitions.


Record Batch:
 Records are accumulated into  record batch. 
 Sending records one at a time would be inefficeint due to the over head of the  network requests   
 So the Producer will accumulate the records assigned to a given partition into  batches.
 Batches provides for much more effective compression when compression is used

The producer has control as to when the record batch should be drained and sent to the broker 
  =This is controlled by two properties
   =>One is by time
   =>The another is size

So once enough time or enough data has been accumulated in those record batches, those record batches will be drained, and will form a produce request.
Then record batches will be sent to the broker.

Kafka sees this new group.id and creates the group automatically in the __consumer_offsets topic.
ChatGPT said:

Yes — exactly. Let me explain precisely how Kafka creates consumer groups automatically and what happens internally in the __consumer_offsets topic.

✅ How Kafka Automatically Creates Consumer Groups

When a consumer application first connects to Kafka with:

group.id=my-group


Kafka does the following automatically, without any command or admin action:

🔹 Step 1 — Consumer sends JoinGroup request

The consumer sends a JoinGroup request to the Kafka broker (the Group Coordinator for that group).

Kafka checks:

Does this group.id already exist?

Do I (the broker) have metadata for this group?

If not → the group is created in memory.

🔹 Step 2 — Kafka creates a new entry in __consumer_offsets

When a consumer sends its first committed offset, Kafka writes a message to:

__consumer_offsets


This is a compact internal topic that stores:

committed offsets

group metadata

generation IDs

leadership info

Kafka writes:

(group.id=my-group, partition=offsets-partition-X) → metadata record


This is how the group becomes persistent.

🎯 There is no command like CREATE GROUP.
The act of connecting with a new group.id creates the group.

🔹 Step 3 — Broker designated as Group Coordinator

Kafka assigns:

every group to one partition of __consumer_offsets

that partition has a leader broker

that broker becomes the Group Coordinator

Example:

group.id = my-group
→ assigned to __consumer_offsets partition 14
→ broker 2 is leader → broker 2 is the coordinator

🔹 Step 4 — Group appears in kafka-consumer-groups

Once metadata is written to the offsets topic, running:

kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server ... --list


will show:

my-group


Even if:

the group has no active members

the consumer app is not running now

🧠 Why this matters for your issue

Your cluster output showed:

Leader: -1 for __consumer_offsets partition(s)


If the offsets topic partition that stores your group is leaderless, then:

Kafka cannot create the group

Kafka cannot commit offsets

kafka-exporter cannot read lag

kafka-consumer-groups.sh hangs or errors

This is exactly why you see:

exporter timeouts

“in the middle of a leadership election”

leader = -1

🔍 Want to see which offsets partition your group uses?

Run:

kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
  --bootstrap-server <broker> \
  --describe \
  --group <your-group> \
  --state


It shows:

Coordinator: <broker-id>


Then run:

kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic __consumer_offsets --bootstrap-server <broker>


Look for the partition where <broker-id> is the leader — that is the partition holding your group.

If you want, tell me the consumer group name

➡ I will tell you which offsets partition it uses,
➡ and why kafka-exporter fails on that exact partition.

---------


Check Kafka server logs for ERROR, WARN, leader change, NetworkProcessor, RequestHandler, DiskError.

Check JMX metrics: request queue sizes, RequestHandlerAvgIdlePercent, replication fetcher times, ISR changes.

Inspect GC logs for pause spikes in same timeframe.

Check disk I/O iostat and iotop to see if storage saturated.

Check network for retransmits and interface errors (/proc/net/snmp, ss -s).


If JVM GC is root cause: consider rolling restart with tuned GC flags; if disk or network is root cause, remediate infra (move partitions, replace disks, fix MTU, NIC drivers).

Describe Topics with Replica Info
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --topic <topic>


Example output:

Topic: my-topic   PartitionCount: 3  ReplicationFactor: 2  Configs:
    Partition: 0  Leader: 101  Replicas: 101,102  Isr: 101,102
    Partition: 1  Leader: 102  Replicas: 102,103  Isr: 102,103
    Partition: 2  Leader: 103  Replicas: 103,101  Isr: 103,101


Here:

Replicas = which brokers host replicas (placement)

Leader = active leader broker

ISR = in-sync replicas

🔹 2. Export All Topics’ Replica Placement

To dump replica placement for all topics:

kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe > topics_rpp.txt

🔹 3. Extract Only Replica Placement (Cleaner Output)
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe | \
awk '/Topic:/ {topic=$2} /Partition:/ {print topic, "Partition=" $2, "Leader=" $4, "Replicas=" $6, "ISR=" $8}'


Sample output:

my-topic Partition=0 Leader=101 Replicas=101,102 ISR=101,102
my-topic Partition=1 Leader=102 Replicas=102,103 ISR=102,103
my-topic Partition=2 Leader=103 Replicas=103,101 ISR=103,101

🔹 4. Export to CSV
echo "Topic,Partition,Leader,Replicas,ISR" > topics_rpp.csv
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe | \
awk '/Topic:/ {topic=$2} /Partition:/ {print topic","$2","$4","$6","$8}' >> topics_rpp.csv


This gives a structured CSV with topic name, partition, leader, replicas, and ISR → effectively the replica placement policy.

✅ This will give you a full export of replica placement for every topic/partition.

Do you want me to extend this into a ready-to-run shell script that you can just run once and it will generate the CSV for your whole cluster?

  | jq -r '.items[] | select(.subjects[]?.name=="my-app-sa") | .metadata.name + " → " + .roleRef.kind + "/" + .roleRef.name'






Kannika API only needs the public key (from JWKS) to verify tokens.

curl -X POST https://api.kannika.example.com/gql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { createBackup(input:{name:\"daily\"}) { id status } }"}'

his is exactly what Kannika API does internally when it receives a Bearer token.

The API checks the token signature against the OIDC provider’s public keys.

Step 1: Define a Backup CRD (example)
apiVersion: mybackup.io/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: kafka-topic-backup
  namespace: backup-system
spec:
  target:
    kind: KafkaTopic
    name: my-topic
  storage:
    type: s3
    bucket: kafka-backups
    prefix: my-topic


This represents the backup resource. (In real-world setups, a controller/operator like Velero or Kanister would reconcile this and actually perform the backup.)

🔄 Step 2: Create a Job for backup
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kafka-backup-job
  namespace: backup-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: backup
          image: mybackup-tool:latest
          command: ["backup.sh"]
          args: ["--target=my-topic", "--bucket=kafka-backups"]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure


This will run the backup one time.

⏲️ Step 3: Schedule backups using CronJob
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: kafka-backup-schedule
  namespace: backup-system
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"   # Every day at 2 AM
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: backup
              image: mybackup-tool:latest
              command: ["backup.sh"]
              args: ["--target=my-topic", "--bucket=kafka-backups"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure

🔄 Step 4: Restore Job
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kafka-restore-job
  namespace: backup-system
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: restore
          image: mybackup-tool:latest
          command: ["restore.sh"]
          args: ["--target=my-topic", "--bucket=kafka-backups", "--snapshot=latest"]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure


✅ Flow:

CronJob → schedules backup jobs.

Backup stored in S3/minio/etc.

Restore job → recreates data/configs when needed.

If you’re using Velero/ Kanister, the CRDs (Backup, Restore) are already provided.

👉 Naveen, do you want me to give you a Velero-based real example (with Backup and Restore kinds) instead of this generic simulation? That way you can actually apply and run it on your kind cluster.

Prepare Before Speaking

Note specific instances with date, time, and impact on your work.

Be ready with examples where interruptions, extended calls, or after-hours messages delayed deliverables or caused errors.

Frame your concern as a productivity and work quality issue, not a personal criticism.

2. Use a Professional Conversation Structure

a. Start with appreciation

“I appreciate how actively you’re involved and how you want things on track. It shows you care about the outcome.”

b. State the impact (not the person)

“Lately, I’ve noticed BAU calls running beyond the scheduled time and frequent desk visits/calls for updates. While I understand the intent, these frequent interruptions make it harder for me to stay focused and complete tasks efficiently.”

c. Show consequences

“Sometimes, when I’m mid-task and have to switch context repeatedly, it slows progress and increases the chance of mistakes. It also extends my work hours.”

d. Propose a constructive solution

“Would it help if we had a fixed daily/weekly update slot for status, and I send a short written update in between? This way, you still have visibility, and I can keep focus on delivering work faster.”

e. Address after-hours calls politely

“If something is urgent, I’m happy to address it after hours, but for non-critical items, could we keep them for the next day’s sync? That helps me maintain a balance while still keeping priorities in check.”

3. Keep Your Tone Neutral

Avoid “You always…” or “You don’t let me…” → Instead, use “I’m finding it challenging when…”

Stay calm even if they push back.

Keep the discussion about workflow, not personality.

4. Follow Up in Writing
If this is a formal workplace, you can also send a short, polite email summarizing the agreed points after your discussion. This makes it easier to refer back if the behavior continues.

If you’d like, I can draft you a ready-to-use short email that makes this point firmly but respectfully so it doesn’t sound like you’re complaining. This way, it’s on record but still professional.

Do you want me to prepare that email?



My Technical Contributions
Over the past months, I have been deeply involved in the following areas:

Kafka, Cluster Linking, VVP, and DataStage product suites.

Recent hands-on work with the Kannika product and IBM MQ-based tasks as per JIRA assignments.

Proactively engaging with Confluent for Kubernetes and related tools that I highlighted as bold focus areas in last year’s survey.

I also value the emphasis you've placed on data center backup and restore, and I fully understand its criticality in the OCC (Operational Control Center) context. I make it a point to align my practices with this direction.

These are areas where I feel confident and contribute with an expert-level understanding.

🧭 Concerns with Project Management (ABC)
While I remain committed to delivering high-quality results, I’d like to share some concerns regarding the current project manager, ABC, which have been consistently affecting team morale and productivity:

Redundant Questioning: Key use cases (e.g., VVP workspace creation) are asked repeatedly even after being clearly explained. This has happened multiple times with different teammates.

Incorrect Technical Directions: ABC occasionally provides incorrect implementation suggestions for production workflows, which could lead to operational risks.

Inefficient Meetings: Our daily meetings often stretch 45 minutes to an hour without clear outcomes, mainly due to repetitive discussions led by ABC.

Lack of Recognition: Technical input shared by me is often passed to management without acknowledgment, which feels demotivating.

Follow-through Gaps: Important technical discussions often do not result in action or proper documentation.

Confidentiality Breach: I’ve experienced performance-related discussions being shared internally, which impacted me personally and did not reflect a professional standard.

Low Ownership During Pressure: Unlike many managers who take up small JIRA tasks or assist technically, ABC often remains distant even when the team is under significant workload.

🙏 Intent and Outlook
I am sharing this feedback not with the intent of blame, but to support a more accountable, collaborative, and technically sound environment—one that aligns with the high standards we all strive for.

I’d appreciate your guidance on how best to handle this moving forward or if a more formal channel is preferred for such feedback.

Thank you for your attention and leadership.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Job Title or Department]
[Your Contact Information]

Let me know if you'd like this tailored to a more informal tone, or if you're sending it via an internal platform (like Outlook, Slack, etc.).


============
Subject: Constructive Feedback Regarding Project Management Challenges

Dear [Executive Director's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to bring to your attention some ongoing concerns regarding the project management style and approach of [Project Manager ABC], which I believe are impacting team productivity and morale.

Over the past months, I have been actively contributing to multiple high-impact areas, including Kafka, Cluster Linking, VVP, Datastage, and more recently Kannika and MQ products, handling multiple Jira tasks. I feel confident and technically sound in these domains.

However, I’ve observed the following challenges while working under ABC’s coordination:

Repetitive Questions & Inefficient Communication:
Important use cases and product scenarios (e.g., VVP workspace creation) are often re-discussed unnecessarily in multiple meetings. The same questions are asked again with other team members, leading to confusion and redundancy.

Incorrect Technical Inputs:
At times, ABC provides technical suggestions that are incorrect or misaligned, which have been directed toward production implementation. This creates risks in sensitive environments.

Unproductive Meetings:
Daily meetings often extend up to 45 minutes to an hour with repetitive discussions, reducing valuable development and analysis time for the team.

Technical Input Not Acknowledged:
While I frequently provide technical feedback, it is often repackaged and forwarded to higher management without clarity or appropriate action being taken.

Lack of Follow-Through:
Several technical discussions end without action or follow-up from ABC, which impacts our delivery timelines and accountability.

Concerns with Confidentiality and Professionalism:
On one occasion, I experienced discomfort when personal performance-related concerns were shared within the team, breaching professional confidentiality norms.

Limited Team Support in High-Pressure Times:
Unlike other managers, ABC does not engage in Jira resolution or contribute technically, even during critical project phases when the team is under significant pressure.

I am sharing this as constructive feedback with the hope that it will help foster a more effective and professional working environment. My intention is to ensure that the team functions smoothly and delivers high-quality outcomes, and I remain committed to contributing with my full capabilities.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further if needed.

List all current aliases (verbose):
keytool -v -list -keystore truststore.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -storepass password

Check if desired alias is already used:
keytool -list -keystore truststore.p12 -alias <alias> -storepass password

If alias exists and you want a clean import, delete it first:
keytool -delete -alias <alias> -keystore truststore.p12 -storepass password

Import the new certificate:
keytool -importcert \
  -alias <alias> -file newcert.crt \
  -keystore truststore.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -storepass password
Or to overwrite without prompt:


keytool -importcert … -noprompt
🧾

----
Important Considerations
Verify existing entries before importing:

bash
Copy code
keytool -list -keystore /apps/DataStage/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts-ts.jks \
  -storetype JKS -storepass cit
Backup your keystore file before making changes.

Confirm certificate file format: .cer must be in DER or PEM format accepted by Java Keytool.

Understand truststore locations in IBM InfoSphere:

Common paths include:

/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBServer/conf/iis-client-truststore.p12

/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBServer/conf/isf-node.keystore 
scribd.com
+2
ibm.com

ibm.com
+2
stackoverflow.com
+1
manuallib.com
+1
scribd.com
+3
pdfcoffee.com
+3
scribd.com
+3
scribd.com

You may need to import to those depending on DataStage tier.

Restart services (e.g., DataStage engine, ASBServer, WebSphere) after import to apply the updated certificate.

✅ Step-by-Step Renewal Process
Backup your existing truststore:

bash
Copy code
cp /apps/DataStage/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts-ts.jks \
   /apps/DataStage/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts-ts.jks.bak
Optionally list existing certificates:

bash
Copy code
keytool -list -keystore /apps/DataStage/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts-ts.jks \
  -storetype JKS -storepass cit
Import the new certificate (using the corrected command above).

Re-verify the alias appeared:

bash
Copy code
keytool -list -keystore /apps/DataStage/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts-ts.jks \
  -storetype JKS -storepass cit | grep db-ssl-dutla55l
Restart relevant DataStage components to ensure they load the updated keystore.

📌 Final Notes
Ensure the truststore you're updating is the one used by your JDBC or ASBServer SSL configurations.

If your environment uses PKCS12 files (e.g., .p12), substitute -storetype PKCS12 and password accordingly.

Always use consistent, absolute paths and verify current configurations before making changes.

Let me know if you want help verifying which truststore DataStage is actually using in your setup!

Checkpoint / Savepoint Failures
Cause:
Slow or failing checkpoint storage (e.g., S3, HDFS).
Inconsistent state causing deserialization errors.
High checkpointing frequency causing excessive I/O.
Resolution:
✅ Verify checkpoint storage (state.checkpoints.dir).
✅ Reduce checkpointing frequency (execution.checkpointing.interval: 60s).
✅ Use incremental checkpoints (state.backend.incremental: true).
✅ Check logs for state deserialization errors.

5. Network Failures
Cause:
Flink JobManager and TaskManager communication issues.
Kubernetes/YARN network connectivity problems.
Resolution:
✅ Check Flink logs (jobmanager.log, taskmanager.log).
✅ Increase network retries (akka.ask.timeout: 30s).
✅ Verify Kubernetes networking (kubectl get pods -o wide).
✅ Tune network buffer settings (taskmanager.network.memory.*).

6. JobManager Failure
Cause:
High memory consumption in JobManager.
Checkpointing taking too long.
JobManager lost connection with TaskManagers.
Resolution:
✅ Restart JobManager (flink run ...).
✅ Enable high-availability mode (high-availability: zookeeper).
✅ Increase JobManager memory (jobmanager.memory.process.size).
✅ Check JobManager logs (kubectl logs <jobmanager-pod>).

7. Unexpected Serialization Issues
Cause:
Incompatible class versions between job upgrades.
Using non-serializable objects in operators.
Resolution:
✅ Ensure compatible state serialization (state.backend.rocksdb.enable-native = true).
✅ Use Flink’s TypeSerializer instead of Java serialization.
✅ Use savepoints for state migration.

8. Job Stuck in Restart Loop
Cause:
Job restart strategy triggers too frequently.
Persistent errors (e.g., state corruption, dependency issues).
Resolution:
✅ Check Flink restart strategy (restart-strategy: fixed-delay).
✅ Increase delay between restarts (restart-strategy.fixed-delay.delay: 10s).
✅ Verify dependencies (flink run --jar job.jar).

metrics to view before rebalancing a partitions 
Before rebalancing partitions in Kafka, it is important to monitor several key metrics to ensure that the cluster is healthy and that the rebalancing
Wwill not cause any disruption to the ongoing data processing. Some of the key metrics to consider include:


Broker CPU and memory utilization: Rebalancing partitions may cause a temporary increase in CPU and memory utilization on the brokers.
these metrics to ensure that the brokers have sufficient resources to handle the increased load during the rebalancing process


You should monitor


increase in network traffic as the brokers exchange metadatą and data between each other. You
and the network infrastructure can handle the increased load during the rebalancing process

Topic and partition lag: Topic and partition lag is an important metric to monitor in Kafka, as it indicates
and the time it is consumed. If there is a significant lag in a topic or partition, it may indicate that the

Partition skew: Partition skew is a metric that indicates the imbalance of data distribution across partitions in a topic. If there is a significant

. Check Topic Retention Configuration
To view the current retention policy for a topic:


bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --entity-type topics --entity-name <topic-name>
Look for the retention.ms, retention.bytes, and cleanup.policy properties.

2. Set or Update Data Retention Policy
Modify the retention configuration for an existing topic:

a) Retention Based on Time (retention.ms)
Example: Keep data for 7 days (7 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds * 1000 ms):

bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type topics --entity-name <topic-name> --alter --add-config "retention.ms=604800000"

b) Retention Based on Size (retention.bytes)
Example: Limit the topic size to 1 GB:


bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type topics --entity-name <topic-name> 
--alter --add-config "retention.bytes=1073741824"

c) Set Cleanup Policy (cleanup.policy)
Options: delete (default) or compact
Example to enable log compaction:

bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --entity-type topics --entity-name <topic-name> --alter --add-config "cleanup.policy=compact"

3. Verify Updated Retention Settings
To confirm the changes:

bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --entity-type topics --entity-name <topic-name>
4. Broker-Level Retention Configurations (Global Settings)
You can set retention configurations globally in server.properties:

log.retention.ms=604800000      # Retention period (7 days)
log.retention.bytes=1073741824  # 1 GB per partition
log.segment.bytes=1073741824    # Segment file size
log.cleanup.policy=delete       # Cleanup policy
Restart the Kafka broker after making changes:

bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties


5. Remove Data from a Topic Manually
To delete all data from a topic:


bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
--delete --topic <topic-name>
